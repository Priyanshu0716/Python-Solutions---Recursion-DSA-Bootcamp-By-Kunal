# In this program we will find the length of string using recursion. For this we will use the slicing technique of strings.

def lengthOfString(s):
  
  if s == "" :  # base condition
    return 0
  
  return 1 + lengthOfString(s[1:]) # here s[1:] will return the string sliced from 1st position till the end. Eg. s = "priyanshu" and s[1:] will give "riyanshu" and so on.
  
 
input --> s = 'priyanshu'
output --> 9
